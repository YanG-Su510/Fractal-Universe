# SinBeats
This is a project created for UNSW course ADAD3402 of T2 2020.

The central idea of this project should explore around Generative Art, the computer-generated images by interacting with human. It should emphasize the idea of randomness within control from designer.

Name Changed: Fractal Universe -> SinBeats

SinBeats is a concept of open public installation. Iâ€™d like you to explore the beauty of numbers with computer-generated 
images.
